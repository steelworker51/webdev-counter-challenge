# Counter Challenge

This challenge's primary focus is reading code that you have not written yourself. There is very little code to write, but it will require some thought to solve.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git:** Version control system to clone and manage the repository.
- **GitHub:** make sure you have an account to sync your repositories to.
- **Code Editor:** Any code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Cloning the Repository

Follow these steps to fork and clone the repository:

1. Open your terminal or Git Bash.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
3. Fork the repository.
4. Clone the forked repository to edit on your local computer.

### Viewing the Project

To view the project locally, you can either open the project files in your code editor or open the HTML files in your browser.

### Tasks

- [ ] Read `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js` carefully.
- [ ] Update **only** the media query in `style.css`. The mockups are in the mockups folder.
- [ ] Read `app.js` again and reference `quiz.txt`
- [ ] Write the missing code in `app.js` to implement the functionality of the buttons.
- [ ] Answer the questions in `quiz.txt`.

### Tips
- Push a commit for each task completed. Include a meaningfull commit message.
- Before the above, update the readme task list to track your progress. To do this, enter x between the brackets.
- Get used to using your browser's developer tools now. For now, become familiar with: 
    - Toggling between desktop mode and device emulation/responsive mode.
    - Using inspector mode to inspect elements.


### Submitting Your Work

After completing the assignment, make sure to commit your changes and push them back to your own repository and turn in the GitHub link in Google Classroom.
